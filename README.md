# Flea-Market - A server-side market-esque mod

Flea Market is a market mod designed to replicate a flea market(heh, get it)

Flea market adds a command-based market mod that allows players to sell specific items in a given period of time. Once a player has sold the current item, they cannot sell it again and will have to wait until another item is on offer. Once the item offer cycle is complete, then a player can start selling those items again.

More information about the Flea market can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/zellfrey/FleaMarket/wiki).
